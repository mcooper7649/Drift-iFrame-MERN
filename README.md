## DRIFT Information

Prerequisites - Create .env file in the server folder root AND the client folder root. update your process.env entries to match the entries for our DRIFT_ID (client) AND MONGO_CONNECT (server).

Once you've passed along client ID info and the Server connection info our local instance should run and we can see our Drift iframe instance running.

DM Michael Cooper on slack if you need a better explanation. I'm happy to help.

We will need to npm i and npm start from both CLIENT and SERVER to run our local instance.
